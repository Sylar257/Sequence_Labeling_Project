# Sequence_Labeling_Project

Linguistic *sequence labeling* is a general approach encompassing a verity of problems. One of the crucial reason that this repo exists is because a collection of techniques used in this project is one of the building blocks of my [surgical robotics vision]() project. In addition to that, we are going to replicate the architecture used in the [Empower Sequence Labeling with Task-Aware Neural Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04109.pdf) paper, which is considered as one of the more sophisticated models out there for tasks such as **Poart-Of-Speech** (POS) and **Named-Entity-Recognition** (NER). This paper is packed of useful techniques that can be potentially extended to other deep learning applications.

Acknowledgement, this repo is heavy guided by [sgrvinod](https://github.com/sgrvinod)â€˜s tutorial and also a few ideas that I have learned from the [FastAI course v3](https://course.fast.ai/).
